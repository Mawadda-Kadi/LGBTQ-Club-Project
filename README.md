## Bugs

### Bugs Fixed

- Wrong Favicon Links:

Bug: The website was configured with incorrect favicon links, resulting in missing favicon on all pages.
Fix: I verified and updated the favicon links in the HTML <head> section by fixing a link typo. I ensured the links point to valid and existing favicon images.

- Navigation Bar Responsiveness:

Bug: The navigation bar (navbar) did not respond well to different screen sizes, leading to layout problems and usability issues on smaller devices.
Fix: I implemented a responsive navigation design. I considered a mobile-friendly menu, such as a hamburger menu, for smaller screens. I used media queries to adjust styles and layout based on screen width.

- Cover-Text Responsiveness:

Bug: The cover text, positioned over hero images, lacked responsiveness on various screen sizes, leading to layout issues.
Fix: I applied responsive design principles to the cover text. I used relative units (percentage) for dimensions and adjusted positioning using media queries. then I tested it on different devices to ensure proper responsiveness.

- Events Cards Image Display Issue: (Main Issue)

Bug: The initial implementation of the events cards resulted in poor responsiveness and improper display of images, requiring a complete code overhaul for better performance and visual presentation.
Fix:
HTML Structure:
- I ensured each event card had a consistent and well-defined structure.
- I used semantic HTML elements for better accessibility.
CSS Styles:
- I implemented the same style of already exsisting card code in Home page which gave them flexible and responsive layout using CSS Flexbox, transition and hover effect.
- I set appropriate dimensions for the event card and image containers.

- Logo Images Border:
Bug: The initial attempt to enhance the appearance of logo images by applying borders resulted in images being smaller than the border size, even with the use of the object-fit property. A more effective solution was needed to achieve the desired visual effect.
Fix: Instead of applying the object-fit property, I set a max-width property for the container (id="image-card-resources") to define the maximum width of the logo image. This ensured that the container won't expand beyond a certain size, preventing the border from being smaller or larger than intended.

- Map Alignment Issue:

Bug: The map on the website was not aligned correctly, causing overlap with surrounding elements.
Fix: I checked the CSS styles applied to the map container and ensured proper margins and padding. Then I adjusted the dimensions and positioning as needed.


### Known Bugs:
This is a simple website. Therefore, there is no bug so far.
The following limitations, however, should be put into consideration:

- Limited Content:

Issue: The Events and Resources sections suffer from a shortage of content, potentially resulting in an unsatisfactory user experience.
Impact: Inadequate content may lead to reduced engagement and fail to meet user expectations.

- Limited Interactivity:

Issue: The website lacks interactive features, such as real-time updates or mechanisms for user feedback.
Impact: Limited interactivity can diminish user engagement and hinder the site's ability to gather valuable feedback for improvement.

- Lack of Backend Implementation:

Issue: Absence of backend functionality results in the non-persistent storage of user registration data. This means an inability to manage, retrieve, or analyze user information.
Impact: Without backend support, critical functionalities like user management, data analysis, and secure data storage are compromised.
